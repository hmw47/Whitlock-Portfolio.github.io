    <h2>Bad Photoshop</h2>
    
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">“Bad Photoshop” was a project meant to challenge 
        yourself by embracing imperfection. The objective was to create three composite 
        images from self-made contemporary still-lifes, influenced by Lucas Blalock.</p>
    
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">We were instructed to use Adobe Photoshop and create 
        compositions that blur the lines between art and imperfection by exploring functions 
        and revealing the tools of creation. We specifically had to emphasize the use of the 
        eraser tool, layer masking, clone stamp tool, selection tools, and blur filters.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px;">I am personally an imperfectionist when it comes to art. 
        I have even been tasked with practicing to draw with my left hand to accept faults and 
        flaws in my work. So, this project was especially challenging because it went against 
        my nature to make something that wasn’t “correct”. In fact, this project was probably 
        one of the most time-consuming projects this semester, because of how many times I had 
        to start over. At some point, I had to just accept the fact that the result was meant to 
        be chaotic. I focused on staging my still lifes and adding features digitally, creating 
        a veil between what's really there and what appeared virtually. I was able to achieve 
        this by using a variety of tools and making it obviously chalant.</p>
