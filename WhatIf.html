    <h2>What If</h2>
    
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">“What If” was an extensive project that encouraged us, as 
        students, to compose imagery based on a narrative foundation. We were asked to choose 
        from three speculative fiction themes to build our project around. We researched our 
        themes and curated images to base two symbolic token designs on. This project was all 
        about design.</p>
    
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">We used Adobe Illustrator to create the two tokens that 
        represent the narrative you fabricated. I personally used Pinterest to assemble my 
        resources and Adobe Photoshop to edit them before creating the tokens on Adobe 
        Illustrator.</p>
    
        <br>
        <h3>Narrative</h3>
    
        <h4>Written in Stone</h4>
    
        <p>The cold wind bit Blair’s skin, whipping the loose strands of her 
        hair across her face. The damp air wrapped around the hills, making the
        tops look like little islands in a sea of clouds. Blair had just hiked
        high enough to clear the fog when she reached the dig site. The team 
        usually started around seven in the morning, but after a restless night,
        Blair was eager to hike up to Clava Cairns and begin working.</p>
    
        <p>Each student in the doctorate program for Archaeology at Harvard 
        University was assigned a location as a project to gain experience in the
        field, and the spot at Clava Cairns was designated for Blair. Of course, 
        she knew these structures were significant, but to what extent? What did 
        archaeologists and anthropologists actually know for certain about them, 
        what breakthroughs were being made, and what evidence was written in 
        stone?</p>
    
        <p>Unbuttoning her collar, something caught her eye. There were fresh bare 
        feet printed into the soft dirt around the structure. Slowly, Blair took 
        a cautious step toward the footprints. They disappeared around the bend 
        and into the bush. Without hesitation, she followed them, like another 
        force pulled her onto its path. They led her further up the hill, almost 
        a half-mile, and into a clearing. What stood there took her breath away. 
        In the center of the clearing rose an enormous stone formation, painted 
        red by the rising sun. The fading full moon nested in the center, framed 
        by two tilted pillars.</p>
    
        <p>The world turned silent. Even the wind ceased its persistent howl. 
        Blair made her way to the center of the stone circle. Just then, a sweet 
        melody broke the silence.</p>
    
        <p>“The Song Thrush sings again,”. </p>
    
        <p>Whisking around, Blair turned and found the culprit for the prints. 
        There stood a small, elderly woman, barefoot with nothing but a shift on,
        hair glowing golden against the sunrise. Blair opened her mouth to speak,
        but, stunned, nothing came out.
        </p>
    
        <p>“The woman of the moon has returned. Welcome back, my dear,” the old
        woman smiled.</p>
    
        <p>“I’m sorry…. What?” Blair finds her voice in utter confusion.</p>
    
        <p>“Why you have brought the moon back into rhythm,” the old woman 
        answered. Noticing Blair’s bewilderment, she added, “From the night the 
        moon disappeared, of course. The night the ring of fire was formed and 
        the seas sank into the deep chasms. You have been reborn to steady the 
        tides and bring balance to the world,”.</p>
    
        <p>“The day the moon blinked? That’s just a myth,” gathering her senses,
        she added, “Come down this path with me and I’ll get you a blanket and 
        a hot cup of coffee,”.</p>
    
        <p>“It’s only a myth to those who don’t believe. Don’t worry, darling. 
        Your memory will come back soon,” the old woman said, stepping forward
        and grabbing Blair’s hand.</p>
    
        <p>She gently pulled Blair around to the stone she had her back to. The 
        moon barely hovered over the top of it, now. There it was, right in front 
        of her, written in stone.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px;">There were two specific techniques I used that legitimized 
        the designs. Typing text in the round and using a clipping mask to round off images were 
        two methods I utilized to create a more refined token. The only thing I had a hard time 
        with was narrowing down my ideas, so I just ended up making four tokens instead of two 
        and submitting my two least favorites as extras for fun. I definitely took advantage of 
        this project. I wanted to make the best images I could, but I also just wanted to create 
        something that I loved while exploring Adobe Illustrator. I’m especially proud of the 
        use of my knowledge in Adobe Photoshop from previous assignments to attain the desired 
        results.</p>
